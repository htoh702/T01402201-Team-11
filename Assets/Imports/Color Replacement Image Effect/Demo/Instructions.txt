Thank you for downloading the Color Replace Image Effect! 
This is a setup guide for the image effect. 

Instructions:

Add the "ColorReplacement.cs" script to your main camera
Drag the "ColorReplacement.shader" to the "CR shader" -slot on the script.

To replace a color:
As the "Mask Color"-color select your color of choice. This color will work as 
a mask. If the effect is not behaving as you expect it to, change the 
"Tolerance" value. If the Tolerance = 0, the effect won't show.
On the "Replace Color" -color select your replacement color. 
This color will tint your Mask Texture, if you have one. 

How the ColorReplacement.cs works:
All the stuff happens inside OnRenderImage(). It only takes your set variables 
(like MaskColor, ReplaceTexture, Tolerance) and sends them to the shader.
